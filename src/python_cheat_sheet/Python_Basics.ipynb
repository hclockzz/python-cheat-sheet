This model offers a series of bands at different grit levels (from coarse to very fine) that allow you to do everything from major knife repair to small finishing work. </p>\\n<p>The Ken Onion also allows you to choose the type of blade geometry for whatever implement you're sharpening and has angle guides to ensure the edge is sharpened at the correct angle This way, you can go with whichever edge profile you prefer, whether it’s symmetrical or asymmetrical, and sharpen it consistently every time without having to rely on the muscle memory that you’d need for a whetstone (which can be a major barrier for entry for people new to knife-sharpening). Better yet: Because of the angle options, the sharpener can be used on all sorts of blades, including ax heads, mower blades, and pocket knives. </p>\\n<p>If you’re concerned about the price, think about it this way: After a couple of years, it will pay for itself in sharpening fees.</p>\\n<p><dorado id=\\\"work-sharp-ken-onion-knife-sharpener\\\" /></p>\\n\",\n",

Sharpening will remove tiny fibers to create a brand new edge; honing ensures the edge is straight. You’ll need to do both if you want a sharp and safe knife. You can see <a href=\\\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/knife-skills-how-to-hone-a-dull-knife.html\\\">Kenji’s technique for knife-honing right here</a>. You can repeat this process any time you use your knives. Though once you notice that honing isn't helping, it's time to bring out your sharpener. </p>\\n<p>But which honing steel should you choose? </p>\\n<p>In his <a href=\\\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/09/how-to-choose-knife-honing-steel.html\\\">review of the best honing steels</a>, Daniel outlines three different types: stainless steel, ceramic, and diamond steels. Whichever one you choose, consider the length. The longer the steel, the more space you have to pull your knife along without hitting your workstation. As long as your knives aren't longer than 10 inches, a 12-inch steel should serve you well. </p>\\n<p>Stainless steel steels are the most common. For its comfort and price, the 12-inch Winware is Daniel's favorite. An added bonus of metal honing steels is that they're magnetic, so they can hold on to those microscopic metal shards as you hone. That means less cleanup and far less chance of those shards getting into your food! </p>\\n<p><dorado id=\\\"stainless-steel-honing-steel\\\" /></p>\\n<p>Then you have ceramic and diamond steels, which have potential benefits and drawbacks depending on how diligent you are about taking care of your knives. Since they're both more abrasive, they can actually remove more metal from your knife than steels made from stainless steel. That's great if you wait a long time between sharpening sessions, but it isn't so great if you plan on steeling your knife every day. If you find yourself reaching for your honing steel often, it's best if you stick to stainless steel. </p>\\n<p><dorado id=\\\"ceramic-honing-steel,diamond-honing-steel\\\" /></p>\\n\",\n",
